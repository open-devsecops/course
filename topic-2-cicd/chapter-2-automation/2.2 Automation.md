# Introduction to DevOps and CI/CD

## Problem Space

‚ö†Ô∏è Imagine you are writing code for a project idea you have yourself. As your project begins to grow, you hire more developers.


**Challenge:** With new developers on board, miscommunication and bottlenecks in deploying updates start to emerge. The cohesive understanding of the project diminishes.


> As your product grows, along with your development team, the need for scalable systems intensifies. Retrofitting scalability into a codebase not originally designed for growth can lead to considerable challenges, necessitating potentially extensive revisions. Therefore, it's crucial to **incorporate scalability from the beginning**, ensuring that your product's success leads directly to improved performance and user satisfaction, rather than technical debt and operational difficulties.
