# Topic 2 - Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

| Chapter | Learning Objectives | Lab Description |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Chapter 1: Containerization | - Define containerization<br> - Understand container images and runtime<br> - Explore benefits<br> - Introduction to artifact repositories | **Lab 1: Containerization**<br>Objective: Gain hands-on experience with containerizing applications and using a registry.<br>- Dockerize a reference application or BYOA (Bring Your Own Application).<br>- Push the container image to an artifactory.<br>- Pull the container image and run the containerized app locally. |
| Chapter 2: What is DevOps and CI/CD | - Explain DevOps and CI/CD concepts<br> - Discuss advantages<br> - Cover key principles and best practices | N/A |
| Chapter 3: Deployment | - Clarify deployment environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)<br> - Explore deployment strategies<br> - Implement CI with Web Hooks | **Lab 2: Automating the CI/CD Pipeline**<br>Objective: Understand the significance of automation in the CI/CD process and gain hands-on experience using webhook triggers.<br>- Configure a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.<br>- Set up webhooks to trigger the pipeline on a new commit.<br>- Implement a deployment job that automatically deploys the containerized app to a production-like environment. |
| Chapter 4: Automated Tests in CI/CD (Optional) | - Distinguish between unit and integration testing | **Lab 3: Automated Tests in CI/CD**<br>Integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.<br>- Incorporate unit and integration tests into the pipeline.<br>- Configure the pipeline to run tests automatically before deployment, with deployment contingent on passing tests. |

| Chapter 1: Containerization | - Define containerization<br>- Understand container images and runtime<br>- Explore benefits<br>- Introduction to artifact repositories | **Lab 1: Containerizing a React Application**<br>Objectives include creating a Docker image of a React application, running it locally, interacting with a running Docker container, and understanding Docker container isolation.<br><br>**Lab 2: Accessing Corporate Network and AWS ECR**<br>Objectives cover establishing a VPN connection to access the corporate network, using internal services to generate AWS IAM credentials, authenticating and pushing Docker images to AWS ECR, and understanding AWS IAM roles and permissions. |
| Chapter 2: DevOps and CI/CD | - Explain DevOps and CI/CD concepts<br>- Discuss advantages<br>- Cover key principles and best practices | **Lab: Configuring a Simple Jenkins Pipeline**<br>This lab automates the process of building and deploying a Dockerized application using Jenkins, introducing the creation of a Jenkins pipeline, configuring webhooks, and setting up a simple CI/CD workflow. |
| Chapter 3: Deployment | - Define deployment environments (dev, stag, prod)<br>- Define deployment strategies<br>- Utilize Web Hooks for CI | **Automating the CI/CD Pipeline**<br>Objective: Understand the significance of automation in the packaging and deploying of an application; gain hands-on experience using webhook triggers; better visualize the flow of the CI/CD pipeline. |
| Chapter 4: Automated Tests in CI/CD (Optional) | - Unit Testing & Integration Testing | **Automated Tests in CI/CD**<br>Integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality. Focus on how automated pipelines take code from commit to deployment and the importance of ensuring applications are robust and bug-free before deployment. |
